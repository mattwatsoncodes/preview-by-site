# Preview by Site
Proof of Concept 'preview by site' functionality, to allow template previewing across a network.

Assuming we have a central 'control' network site responsible for building FSE theme templates, we can preview those themes on individual sub-sites without copying the template across to those sites.

This would likely be used in conjunction with a 'template sync' plugin, that will allow you to sync your templates to your sub sites after you have previewed them.
